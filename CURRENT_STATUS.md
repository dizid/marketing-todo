# Mini-App Framework - Current Status

## What's Working ✓

- **Mini-app component loads correctly** - DefineAudienceMiniApp displays instead of old component
- **Form fields render and function** - All 9 fields visible and interactive
- **Form auto-save works** - Data persists to localStorage via projectStore
- **Form validation works** - Fields show appropriate input types
- **TaskModal component enhanced** - Debugging logs added to track component loading
- **Netlify grok-proxy function works** - API tested and responding with valid AI content
- **Dev server running** - Vite serving on port 3001 with no build errors

## What's Not Working ✗

- **Generate button does nothing** - When clicked, no console logs appear (or partial logs)
- **AI output not displaying** - No output appears in UI after clicking Generate

## Root Cause Unknown

The issue could be at any of these points:
1. Button click not registered by Vue
2. Event handler not bound correctly
3. Function not passed as prop correctly
4. API call fails silently
5. Output generated but not displayed in UI

## Solution Approach

**Comprehensive logging added** to identify the issue:

### Added Debugging to:

1. **AIPanel.vue** (Generate button component)
   - Logs when button is clicked
   - Logs what function is passed as prop
   - Logs when function is called
   - Logs when result is received

2. **MiniAppShell.vue** (AI orchestrator component)
   - Logs form data contents
   - Logs task config
   - Logs prompt template
   - Logs final prompt sent to API
   - Logs API response status
   - Logs parsed output

### Log Output Sequence (Expected)

When you click Generate button, you should see:
```
[AIPanel] Generate button clicked
[AIPanel] Calling generateFn...
[MiniAppShell] Generate clicked
[MiniAppShell] Calling Grok API...
[MiniAppShell] API response status: 200
[AIPanel] Result received: "..."
```

If logs stop anywhere → That's where the bug is

## How to Debug This

### Step 1: Follow TEST_GENERATE_NOW.md
This guide walks through exact steps:
1. Clear cache
2. Open DevTools console
3. Click task
4. Fill form
5. Click Generate
6. Watch console

### Step 2: Find Where Logs Stop
Check which of these appear:
- [ ] `[AIPanel] Generate button clicked` - Button click works
- [ ] `[AIPanel] generateFn: ƒ` - Function prop passed
- [ ] `[AIPanel] Calling generateFn...` - About to call function
- [ ] `[MiniAppShell] Generate clicked` - Function called successfully
- [ ] `[MiniAppShell] Calling Grok API...` - About to fetch API
- [ ] `[MiniAppShell] API response status: 200` - API responded
- [ ] `[AIPanel] Result received:` - Output received in UIPanel

### Step 3: Report Finding
Tell me:
- Which logs appear
- Which logs DON'T appear
- Any error messages (red text in console)
- What you see in the UI

## Files Modified

1. **src/components/TaskMiniApps/core/MiniAppShell.vue** - Added 15 console.log statements
2. **src/components/TaskMiniApps/shared/AIPanel.vue** - Added 5 console.log statements
3. **src/services/taskRegistry.js** - FIXED: Removed duplicate 'social-1' key

### Code
- `src/components/TaskMiniApps/` - Entire mini-app framework (9 files)
  - DefineAudienceMiniApp.vue
  - GeneratePostsMiniApp.vue
  - core/MiniAppShell.vue (245 lines)
  - shared/FormBuilder.vue (200 lines)

  - configs/defineAudience.config.js (140 lines)
  - configs/generatePosts.config.js (186 lines)
  - core/miniAppRegistry.js (41 lines)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Follow **TEST_GENERATE_NOW.md** steps 1-7
2. Capture console output
3. Report which logs appear/stop
4. Provide any error messages

### After Debugging
1. Fix the identified issue
2. Remove debug logging
3. Test complete workflow
4. Create configs for remaining 18 tasks
5. Test all mini-apps
6. Deploy to production

### Long Term
1. Create mini-app configs for all 21 tasks
2. Update taskRegistry for all tasks
3. Test all workflows
4. Consider features like:
   - Batch generation
   - Template saving
   - Results export
   - History/undo

## Server Info

- **Dev Server**: Running on port 3001
- **Netlify Functions**: Can be tested with `npm run netlify:serve`
- **Grok API**: Status 200, responding normally
- **Build**: No errors, compiles successfully

## Architecture

```
Mini-App Framework Flow:
├── TaskModal.vue
│   └── DefineAudienceMiniApp.vue
│       └── MiniAppShell.vue (core orchestrator)
│           ├── FormBuilder.vue (left panel)
│           ├── AIPanel.vue (right panel) ← Generate button here
│           └── OutputSection.vue (bottom panel)
│
Data Flow:
├── User fills form
├── FormBuilder emits changes
├── MiniAppShell watches changes, auto-saves to store
├── User clicks Generate
├── AIPanel calls generateFn from MiniAppShell
├── MiniAppShell builds prompt, calls Grok API
├── Grok API returns AI content
├── AIPanel receives result, emits to MiniAppShell
├── MiniAppShell stores in savedItems
└── OutputSection displays results
```

## Known Issues

1. **Generate button does nothing** - Unknown cause, needs debugging
2. **Minor**: Duplicate setupTask metadata removed, no impact

## What We've Verified

✓ Mini-app files all exist on disk
✓ All imports resolve correctly
✓ Vite compiles without errors
✓ Components load in browser
✓ Form renders and auto-saves
✓ Netlify proxy function works
✓ Grok API responds correctly
✓ taskRegistry correctly maps to new components

## What We Need to Verify

✗ Generate button click is being processed
✗ AIPanel function prop is being passed
✗ API call is being made
✗ Output is being displayed in UI

**To proceed**: Follow the steps in `TEST_GENERATE_NOW.md` and share the console output!
