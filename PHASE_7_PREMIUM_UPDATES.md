## Premium Tier Tasks with tier/what/why/how

### 1. setup-2: Landing Page Creator (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Build professional landing pages in 5 minutes with AI-assisted copy and design suggestions. No coding required—just fill out a form and get a fully responsive landing page.',
why: 'Landing pages are your #1 conversion tool. A well-designed page converts 3-5x better than a generic one. Professional design typically costs $1000+ but you need it immediately.',
how: 'Answer 5 questions about your brand, then use AI to generate headlines and copy. Customize colors and layout, then publish instantly with a custom domain or sharable link.',
```

### 2. setup-4: Prepare Assets (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Organize and create all your brand assets—logos, hero images, demo videos, color palettes, and social media templates. One central place for all brand materials.',
why: 'Consistent branding across all channels builds recognition and trust. Disorganized assets waste time when you need them fast. A brand guideline saves hundreds of hours.',
how: 'Follow the 5-step asset checklist. Create or upload each asset (logo, hero image, videos, colors, social templates). Export as ready-to-use files for any channel.',
```

### 3. setup-5: Tracking Sheet (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Set up professional metrics tracking with Google Sheets or Excel templates. Track sign-ups, sources, conversions, and revenue in one dashboard with built-in formulas.',
why: 'Most startups fail because they don\'t track metrics. You can\'t optimize what you don\'t measure. Real-time metrics reveal which channels work and where to cut.',
how: 'Choose your template (Google Sheets or Excel), copy the column headers, then start entering daily data. Formulas auto-calculate conversion rate, revenue per source, and churn.',
```

### 4. social-2: Engage Followers (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Build a systematic engagement strategy with templated responses for comments, DMs, and community interactions. Turn followers into brand advocates through consistent, authentic engagement.',
why: 'Social media algorithms favor engagement. Posts with replies/comments get 5x more reach. Communities with engaged followers become word-of-mouth growth engines.',
how: 'Review the 10 response templates (for compliments, questions, complaints, feedback requests, etc). Customize them with your voice, then copy-paste when responding to comments.',
```

### 5. social-3: Run Giveaway/Contest (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Plan and launch a giveaway or contest in 5 minutes. Define rules, create promotion assets, and track entries with a template that works for physical or digital prizes.',
why: 'Giveaways drive massive growth (50-200 new followers) in days. Email/signup requirements for entry build your mailing list. Contests create viral sharing moments.',
how: 'Define your prize value, duration, and entry requirements. AI generates the contest description, rules, and promotion copy. Share the link and track entries in a tracker.',
```

### 6. acq-1: Post in Communities (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Distribute your content across 5+ communities (Reddit, ProductHunt, Indie Hackers, HackerNews, Dev.to) with community-specific tone guides and timing recommendations.',
why: 'Communities have millions of quality users. One successful community post can drive 500+ signups. Each community has different norms—wrong tone gets you banned.',
how: 'Choose 2-3 communities to start, read the community-specific tone guide, then craft your post with community rules in mind. Schedule for optimal posting times (3pm-5pm UTC typically best).',
```

### 7. content-2: Create Video Tutorial (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Script a 2-minute product demo video with section-by-section guidance, timing targets, and professional structure. Learn best practices for video that sells.',
why: 'Video converts 80% better than text. Users watch demos instead of reading docs. A 2-minute demo is easier than a 10-page blog post.',
how: 'Fill in your product details, then get an AI-generated script with timing for each section (hook, problem, solution, features, CTA). Record screen capture and voice over.',
```

### 8. content-3: Design Graphics (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Get AI-guided design briefs and step-by-step tutorials for creating graphics (hero images, social assets, infographics). No design skills required—just follow the guidance.',
why: 'Great graphics drive engagement (5-10x more shares). Consistent visual style builds brand recognition. Most people don\'t have access to a designer—AI fills this gap.',
how: 'Describe what you want to create, then get AI-generated design brief with composition, colors, typography, and style tips. Use Canva or Figma to execute following the brief.',
```

### 9. acq-3: Host Webinar/Q&A (Premium)

tier: 'premium',
what: 'Plan a 30-minute webinar or live Q&A with structure, topic guidance, slides outline, and promotion strategy. Turn live events into lead generation machines.',

how: 'Answer 5 questions about your topic and audience, then get a complete webinar outline with intro, 3 main sections, live demo, Q&A format, and follow-up sequence.',
```

### 10. feedback-1: Collect User Feedback (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Create and launch surveys to 10+ users with 5 proven survey templates (NPS, satisfaction, feature request, retention, pricing). Analyze feedback to guide product decisions.',

```

### 12. feedback-3: Iterate on Features (Premium)
```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Prioritize feature requests using an impact/effort matrix. Analyze which features drive the most value relative to implementation complexity. Make data-driven roadmap decisions.',
why: 'Most startups build the wrong features. 70% of coding effort goes to features users don\'t want. Impact/effort matrix ensures you build high-value features first.',
how: 'List 10 feature ideas from user feedback, score each on impact (1-5) and effort (1-5), then AI sorts by impact/effort ratio. Discuss top 3 with your team to decide.',

```

```javascript
tier: 'premium',
what: 'Calculate ROI metrics: cost-per-user, customer lifetime value, payback period, and CAC:LTV ratio. Understand the economics of your growth channels.',
