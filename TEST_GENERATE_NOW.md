## What to Do If Nothing Happens

### Scenario 1: Button Click Causes No Console Output
**This means the button click isn't being registered**

```
1. Check if button is visible (should be blue)
2. Check if button is enabled (not grayed out)
3. Try clicking it again
4. Check console for RED ERROR messages
5. Report: "Button click produces no console logs"
```

### Scenario 2: Console Shows Only `[AIPanel]` Logs
**This means the function isn't being called**

```
Look at: [AIPanel] generateFn:
If it shows: undefined â†’ prop binding broken
If it shows: Æ’ function() â†’ prop passed correctly, so MiniAppShell logs should appear

Report: What generateFn shows + screenshot
```

### Scenario 3: Logs Go Up to `[MiniAppShell] Calling Grok API...` Then Stop
**This means the API call failed**

```
Look for: [MiniAppShell] API response status:
If you see: 404 â†’ Netlify functions not running
If you see: 500 â†’ Server error
If you see: other number â†’ different error

To fix 404:
1. Open new terminal
2. Run: npm run netlify:serve
3. Try Generate again

Report: What status code appears
```

### Scenario 4: All Console Logs Appear But No Output in UI
**This means generation worked but output isn't displaying**

```
Look for: [AIPanel] Result received: "..."
If shown: Generation worked, UI update issue
Check:
1. Is there an error message showing instead?
2. Can you scroll down in the modal?
3. Is output off-screen or hidden?

Report: "All logs successful, output doesn't appear"
```

## Expected Console Output (Full)

If everything works, you should see this:

```
[TaskModal] Loading task component for: setup-1
[TaskModal] componentFn: Æ’ () { ... }
[TaskModal] Loading module...
[TaskModal] Module loaded: Object { default: {â€¦}, __viteHmrId: "â€¦" }
[TaskModal] Component assigned: DefineAudienceMiniApp

(you click Generate)

[AIPanel] Generate button clicked
[AIPanel] generateFn: Æ’ generateAIOutput()
[AIPanel] isValid: true
[AIPanel] Calling generateFn...

[MiniAppShell] Generate clicked
[MiniAppShell] formData: Object { audience_overview: "Tech startups...", industry: "", ... }
[MiniAppShell] taskConfig: Object { id: "define-audience", title: "Define Target Audience", ... }
[MiniAppShell] aiConfig: Object { promptTemplate: "Based on...", temperature: 0.8, maxTokens: 1500 }
[MiniAppShell] Original prompt template: "Based on the following audience information..."
[MiniAppShell] Processed form data: Object { audience_overview: "Tech startups...", ... }
[MiniAppShell] Replacing placeholders...
[MiniAppShell] Replacing {audience_overview} with Tech startups that need to scale...
[MiniAppShell] Final prompt: "Based on the following audience information...\n\nAudience Overview: Tech startups..."
[MiniAppShell] Calling Grok API...

(progress bar reaches ~90%)

[MiniAppShell] API response status: 200
[MiniAppShell] API response data: Object { id: "...", object: "chat.completion", created: 1234567890, ... }
[MiniAppShell] Response text: "Buyer Persona:\n\nName: David Chen\nRole: Engineering Manager..."
[MiniAppShell] Final output: "Buyer Persona:\n\nName: David Chen..."
[AIPanel] Result received: "Buyer Persona:\n\nName: David Chen..."
```

Then in the modal:
- Progress bar reaches 100%
- Output section shows the generated personas
- "Generated successfully!" message appears
- Copy and Use buttons are clickable

## How to Share Logs

If you see errors or problems:

1. **Take a screenshot** of the console showing the logs
2. **Copy the last 10 logs** from the console:
   - Right-click log line
   - Copy message
   - Paste in chat
3. **Report what you expect vs what happened**

Example report:
```
When I click Generate:
- âœ“ [AIPanel] logs appear
- âœ— [MiniAppShell] logs don't appear
- Logs stop at: [AIPanel] Calling generateFn...
- [AIPanel] generateFn: Æ’ (shown in console)
- No error messages
```

## Test Summary

This test verifies:
- âœ“ Mini-app component loads (form visible)
- âœ“ Form auto-save works
- âœ“ AIPanel component is connected
- âœ“ MiniAppShell receives and processes form data
- âœ“ Prompt template correctly substitutes form values
- âœ“ Grok API receives request and responds
- âœ“ Output is returned to UI and displayed

If ALL these work â†’ Mini-app framework is fully functional!
If any fail â†’ Tell me which logs appear and stop, I'll fix it!
