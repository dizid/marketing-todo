# How to Get Your First 10 Customers (Step-by-Step)

Your first 10 customers are the hardest to get. Not because the strategies are complicated, but because everything feels uncertain. You don't have testimonials. You don't have a brand. You might not even have the product fully built yet.

Good news: you don't need any of that. What you need is a systematic approach and the willingness to do things that don't scale.

Here's the exact playbook.

## Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer (Be Ruthlessly Specific)

"Everyone" is not a customer segment. Before you write a single email or post a single tweet, you need to know exactly who you're selling to.

Answer these questions:

- **Who** has the problem you're solving? (Job title, industry, company size)
- **Where** do they hang out online? (Subreddits, LinkedIn groups, Slack communities, X/Twitter)
- **What** have they already tried to solve this problem?
- **How much** are they spending (in time or money) on their current workaround?

Write this down in one sentence: "I help [specific person] solve [specific problem] so they can [specific outcome]."

If you can't complete that sentence clearly, you're not ready to sell yet. Go back and narrow your focus.

**Pro tip:** Tools like [LaunchPilot](https://launchpilot.marketing) include an ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) generator that walks you through this process with AI-guided prompts, so you get a shareable one-pager in minutes instead of hours.

## Step 2: Have 20 Conversations Before You Sell Anything

This is the step most founders skip, and it's the reason most launches fail.

Before you pitch, listen. Reach out to 20 people who fit your ICP and ask them:

- "What's the most frustrating part of [problem area] for you?"
- "How are you handling this today?"
- "If a tool solved this for you, what would it need to do?"

You're not selling. You're validating. These conversations will do three things:

1. Confirm (or kill) your assumptions about the problem
2. Give you the exact language your customers use (gold for copywriting)
3. Build relationships with people who may become your first buyers

Reach out via LinkedIn DMs, email, or relevant online communities. Keep it short: "Hey, I'm researching [topic] for a project. Would love 15 minutes of your time. Happy to share what I learn."

## Step 3: Build a Minimal Landing Page

You don't need a full website. You need one page that explains:

1. **The problem** you solve (in their words, from Step 2)
2. **How** your product solves it
3. **Social proof** (even early beta users or "built by a founder who experienced this")
4. **A clear CTA** (sign up, book a demo, join the waitlist)

Keep it simple. A single page with a headline, three bullet points, and a signup form outperforms a 10-page site every time at this stage.

Use what you learned in your validation conversations for the headline and copy. Mirror their language back to them.

**LaunchPilot's landing page generator** can create a conversion-optimized page from your ICP data and product description, then publish it directly to a custom URL -- no design or coding skills needed.

## Step 4: Mine Your Warm Network (It's Bigger Than You Think)

Your first customers almost always come from people you already know, or people one degree away. This isn't about spamming your Facebook friends. It's about targeted, personal outreach.

Make a list of:

- **Former colleagues** who work in your target industry
- **Friends** who fit your ICP or know people who do
- **LinkedIn connections** in relevant roles
- **People you've chatted with** in online communities
- **Alumni networks** (school, bootcamps, accelerators)

Send each person a personal message. Not a mass email. Something like:

> "Hey [Name], I've been building [product] to help [target audience] with [problem]. I think [specific person / their team] might find it useful. Would you be open to trying it out or pointing me to someone who might?"

Expect a 10-20% positive response rate. From 50 warm messages, you should get 5-10 real conversations.

## Step 5: Go Where Your Customers Already Are

Don't build an audience from scratch yet. Go where audiences already exist.

**Online communities:**
- Reddit: Find 3-5 subreddits where your audience asks questions. Answer those questions genuinely. Build credibility before you ever mention your product.
- Slack/Discord communities: Many industries have active Slack groups. Join them, contribute, then share your tool when relevant.
- Indie Hacker, Product Hunt discussions, and niche forums.

**LinkedIn:**
- Comment on posts from thought leaders in your space.
- Share insights from your validation conversations (without pitching).
- Post about the problem you're solving and your journey building the solution.

**The rule:** Give value 10 times before you ask once.

## Step 6: Cold Outreach That Actually Works

Cold outreach has a bad reputation because most people do it badly. Here's what works:

**The formula:**
1. **Personalization** (reference something specific about them or their company)
2. **Problem** (state the problem you solve -- one sentence)
3. **Proof** (what result you've gotten, even if it's your own result)
4. **Ask** (specific, low-commitment: "Worth a 10-minute call?")

**Example cold email:**

> Subject: Quick question about [their specific challenge]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed [specific observation about their business -- e.g., "your pricing page doesn't mention enterprise plans" or "you recently posted about struggling with lead gen"].
>
> I built [Product] to help [target audience] [specific outcome]. [One early user / I personally] saw [specific result] in [timeframe].
>
> Would it be worth a quick 10-minute call to see if this could help [their company]?

Send 10-20 of these per day. Track opens and replies. Iterate on subject lines and messaging.

**LaunchPilot's outreach tools** generate personalized cold emails and follow-up sequences based on your ICP data, so you can send quality outreach at scale without sounding like a template.

## Step 7: Offer Something They Can't Refuse

Your first 10 customers need a reason to take a chance on an unproven product. Give them one:

- **Extended free trial** (30 or 60 days instead of 14)
- **Lifetime discount** (e.g., "50% off forever as a founding member")
- **White-glove onboarding** (you personally set them up)
- **Money-back guarantee** (remove all risk)

The goal isn't to maximize revenue from these 10 people. The goal is to get them using your product, giving feedback, and becoming advocates.

## Step 8: Create Content That Attracts (Don't Just Chase)

While you're doing outreach, start planting seeds for inbound traffic:

- **Write 2-3 blog posts** that answer the exact questions your ICP types into Google
- **Post on LinkedIn/X** about your building journey -- what you're learning, mistakes, small wins
- **Create one useful resource** (a template, checklist, or calculator) that your ICP would share

Content won't get you your first 10 customers this week. But the posts you write today will compound over the next 6-12 months.

## Step 9: Do Things That Don't Scale

This is the advice Paul Graham gave Y Combinator founders, and it still applies. Your first 10 customers should get an experience that's unreasonably good:

- **Personally onboard** every user (video call, screen share)
- **Check in** after 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days
- **Fix their problems** immediately, even if it means manual work behind the scenes
- **Ask for feedback** and actually implement it

This doesn't scale, and that's the point. These people become your evangelists. They write testimonials. They refer friends. They stick around.

## Step 10: Track Everything, Double Down on What Works

After your first 10 outreach attempts, you'll start seeing patterns:

- Which channels produce the best response rates?
- Which messaging resonates most?
- Where do people drop off in your funnel?

Keep a simple spreadsheet: Name, Channel, Response, Outcome. After 50 touchpoints, you'll know exactly where to focus.

## The Bottom Line

Getting your first 10 customers is 80% outreach and 20% product. You don't need a perfect product, a big following, or a marketing budget. You need:

1. A clear ICP
2. Validated messaging
3. A simple landing page
4. Relentless personal outreach
5. An irresistible offer for early adopters

Every successful company you admire started by getting 10 people to say yes. Your turn.
