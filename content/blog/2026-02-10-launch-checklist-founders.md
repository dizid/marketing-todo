# The Launch Checklist Every Founder Needs

Most launches fail because of what happens before and after launch day, not on the day itself. The founders who nail their launches treat it as a 90-day process: 30 days of preparation, one week of intense execution, and 30 days of follow-through.

Here's the complete checklist. Print it, pin it, check it off.

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (30 Days Before)

### Week 4: Foundation

- [ ] **Define your launch goal.** Not "get users." Something measurable: "50 signups in the first week" or "10 paying customers in the first month." Write it down and share it with someone who'll hold you accountable.

- [ ] **Finalize your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile).** Know exactly who your first 10 customers are: their job title, company size, specific pain point, and where they spend time online. If you can't describe them in one sentence, you're not ready.

- [ ] **Nail your positioning statement.** Complete this: "[Product] helps [specific audience] [achieve specific outcome] by [how it works differently]." Test it on 5 people in your target market. If they don't immediately get it, rewrite it.

- [ ] **Set up your landing page.** One page. Clear headline (their problem, your solution). Three key benefits. Social proof (even "built by a founder who experienced this firsthand" counts). One CTA. [LaunchPilot's landing page generator](https://launchpilot.marketing) can have this live in under an hour.

- [ ] **Install analytics.** GA4 at minimum. Set up conversion tracking on your CTA (signup, purchase, waitlist join). If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

### Week 3: Content & Assets

- [ ] **Write your launch announcement.** Draft the email, social posts, and community posts you'll send on launch day. Don't wing it -- write them now while you're clear-headed, not when you're stressed on launch morning.

- [ ] **Create 3-5 pieces of supporting content.** Blog posts, tweets, or LinkedIn posts that address the problem your product solves. Publish these before launch so there's context when people Google you.

- [ ] **Prepare a demo or walkthrough.** A 2-minute Loom video or GIF walkthrough of your product in action. People want to see it working before they sign up.

- [ ] **Build your launch list.** Every person who might care about your launch: friends in the industry, newsletter subscribers, beta users, people from validation conversations. Aim for at least 100 names. Categorize them: inner circle (personal message), warm network (personalized email), broader audience (social/community post).

- [ ] **Draft your outreach templates.** Write personalized templates for cold email, LinkedIn DMs, and community posts. Personalized means each one references something specific about the recipient -- not just "Hi {first_name}."

### Week 2: Build Buzz

- [ ] **Start sharing your build journey.** Post 3-5 updates about what you're building and why. Share your motivation, a behind-the-scenes look, or an insight from your customer research. Build anticipation without hard-selling.

- [ ] **Join 3-5 relevant communities.** Reddit, Slack groups, Discord servers, LinkedIn groups. Contribute value for two weeks before you mention your product. Answer questions. Share insights. Become a familiar name.

- [ ] **Line up your early supporters.** Ask 10-15 people to be ready to support on launch day: upvote on Product Hunt, share on social, leave a comment, try the product and give feedback. Don't be shy -- people want to help founders.

- [ ] **Set up email sequences.** A welcome email for new signups, a 3-email onboarding sequence, and a feedback request at day 7. Automate these so they run without you touching them on launch week.

### Week 1: Final Prep

- [ ] **Test everything.** Sign up as a new user. Go through the entire flow. Check every link, every form, every email trigger. Have 2-3 friends do the same and report bugs.

- [ ] **Prepare your Product Hunt listing** (if applicable). Title, tagline (60 chars max), description, images, and first comment. Have it ready to submit, not scrambled together at midnight.

- [ ] **Schedule your social posts.** Pre-schedule launch day and launch week social content. Include varied angles: the problem, the solution, your story, a feature highlight, a customer quote (from beta users).

- [ ] **Set up a simple CRM or spreadsheet.** Track every person who shows interest: name, source, status (lead/user/customer), and follow-up date. You'll need this when things get busy.

- [ ] **Write your "Plan B" list.** What if nobody signs up on day one? List 10 actions you can take: more outreach, adjust messaging, offer a deeper discount, post in a new community. Having a Plan B prevents panic.

## Phase 2: Launch Week

### Launch Day

- [ ] **Go live before 8am (your audience's timezone).** People check social media and email in the morning. Be there when they do.

- [ ] **Send your inner circle messages first.** Personal texts, DMs, and emails to your 15-20 closest supporters. Ask them to check it out, share it, and give honest feedback.

- [ ] **Publish your launch announcements.** Post on X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Product Hunt (if using), relevant subreddits, and communities. Use the pre-written posts you prepared.

- [ ] **Send your launch email.** To your full launch list. Subject line: clear, benefit-driven, no clickbait. Keep the email short -- one problem, one solution, one CTA.

- [ ] **Be online and responsive all day.** Reply to every comment, every DM, every email within 30 minutes. Launch day engagement signals matter for algorithms and for building relationships.

- [ ] **Track metrics hourly.** Signups, page visits, traffic sources. Notice what's working and amplify it in real-time.

### Days 2-7

- [ ] **Follow up with everyone who signed up.** Personal email: "Hey, saw you signed up -- any questions?" This simple touch converts trials into customers and gets you invaluable feedback.

- [ ] **Post daily updates.** Share milestones ("50 signups in 24 hours"), learnings, and user feedback (with permission). Keep the momentum visible.

- [ ] **Reach out to 10 new prospects daily.** Don't stop outreach just because you launched. The launch announcement gives you a natural reason to reach out: "We just launched X. Thought it might help with [their specific problem]."

- [ ] **Collect and publish social proof.** Screenshots of positive feedback, user testimonials, usage stats. Add them to your landing page immediately.

- [ ] **Fix bugs fast.** Your first users are your most forgiving audience. Respond to bug reports within hours, fix within a day if possible, and tell them when it's fixed.

## Phase 3: Post-Launch (30 Days After)

### Week 1-2: Learn & Iterate

- [ ] **Analyze your launch data.** Which channels drove the most signups? What was your conversion rate? Where did people drop off? Let data guide your next moves.

- [ ] **Conduct 5-10 user interviews.** Talk to people who signed up, people who didn't convert, and people who churned. Ask: What made you try it? What almost stopped you? What's missing?

- [ ] **Ship your top 3 requested features.** Show users you're listening by implementing the most-requested improvements quickly. Announce each one publicly.

- [ ] **Optimize your landing page.** Update the headline, adjust the copy based on what you learned about what messaging resonated, and add real testimonials.

### Week 3-4: Scale What Works

- [ ] **Double down on your best channel.** If LinkedIn drove 60% of your signups, invest more time there. Ignore vanity metrics -- focus on where actual conversions happen.

- [ ] **Set up a referral mechanism.** It doesn't need to be fancy. Even "know someone who'd find this useful? Forward this email" with a tracking link works.

- [ ] **Start building repeatable content.** Publish weekly: one blog post, 3-5 social posts, one email to your list. Consistency compounds.

- [ ] **Review and adjust pricing** (if needed). Your initial pricing was a guess. Now you have real usage data and customer conversations. Adjust if necessary.

- [ ] **Plan your next milestone.** First 10 customers becomes first 50. First 50 becomes first 100. Set the next target and reverse-engineer the plan to get there.

## The Launch Day Emergency Kit

Things will go wrong. Here's how to handle the most common launch day problems:

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Site goes down | Have a static backup page ready. Communicate openly: "We're seeing huge demand -- fixing now." |
| Zero signups after 4 hours | Send 20 more personal messages. Post in 2 new communities. Adjust your headline. |
| Negative feedback | Respond graciously. Fix what's valid. Ignore what's not constructive. |
| A competitor launches the same day | Ignore them. Focus on your users. There's room for everyone at this stage. |
| You find a critical bug | Fix it, communicate transparently, and offer affected users something extra. |

## The Bottom Line

A successful launch isn't about one big day. It's about 30 days of preparation, focused execution, and 30 days of relentless follow-through.

Don't try to be perfect. Try to be present, responsive, and fast.

Check the boxes. Ship it. Learn. Iterate.
