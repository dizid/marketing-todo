Hey,

Quick question — have you tried generating your first social media post yet?

If not, here's why you should right now:

**It takes less than 2 minutes.** Here's all you do:

1. Open your dashboard
2. Select the **Social Media Post** mini-app
3. Tell it what your product does (one sentence is enough)
4. Hit generate

That's it. LaunchPilot's AI writes a ready-to-post update for LinkedIn, Twitter/X, or wherever your audience hangs out.

**Why this matters:** Most founders stare at a blank screen for 30 minutes trying to write the "perfect" post. Meanwhile, the founders who win? They just post. Consistently. LaunchPilot removes the blank-screen problem entirely.

And you've got **40 free generations this month** — so there's zero risk in trying it out.

[Generate Your First Post](https://launchpilot.marketing/app)

Once you see how fast it is, you'll wonder why you ever wrote marketing copy from scratch.

Talk soon,
The LaunchPilot Team
