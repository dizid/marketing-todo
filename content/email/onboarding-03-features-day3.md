Hey,

By now you've seen how LaunchPilot generates social content. But that's just the start.

Here are **3 features most new users don't discover until week two** — and each one can move the needle on getting your first customers:

---

**1. Landing Page Builder**

Need a page to send traffic to? Describe your product, pick a style, and LaunchPilot generates a complete landing page — headline, copy, CTA, everything. You can publish it directly from the app. No coding, no Figma, no back-and-forth with a designer.

**2. Email Sequence Generator**

Cold outreach. Welcome sequences. Follow-ups. Tell the AI who you're writing to and what you want them to do. It writes the full sequence — subject lines, body copy, calls to action. Ready to paste into your email tool.

**3. Competitor Analysis**

Curious what your competitors are doing? Drop in a competitor's name or URL and get a breakdown of their positioning, messaging angles, and gaps you can exploit. It's like having a strategist on call.

---

All of these are included in your free plan. You have **40 AI generations per month** — that's enough to build a landing page, write an outreach sequence, AND research your top competitor.

The founders who get results fastest? They use more than one tool. Try combining a landing page with a social post driving traffic to it — you'd be surprised how quickly things start clicking.
