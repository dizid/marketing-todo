Hey,

You've been on LaunchPilot for a week now. Whether you've been using it daily or just poking around, here's something worth knowing:

**The founders who get to their first 10 customers fastest all follow a similar pattern.** It's not complicated — it's just consistent.

Here's what that 2-week journey typically looks like:

---

**Week 1: Define + Create**

- **Define your audience.** Use the Target Audience mini-app to get crystal clear on who you're selling to. This sharpens everything else.
- **Generate your first batch of content.** 3-5 social posts, tailored to where your audience spends time. Schedule or post them directly.
- **Write your positioning.** Use the Value Proposition generator so you can describe what you do in one compelling sentence.

**Week 2: Build + Reach Out**

- **Build a landing page.** Even a simple one. Somewhere to send people who are interested. LaunchPilot generates the full page — you just publish.
- **Start outreach.** Use the Email Sequence generator to write personalized cold emails or warm follow-ups. Send 10-20 per day.
- **Analyze and adjust.** Check what's getting traction. Double down on what works.

**The key insight:** You don't need a perfect product, a huge audience, or a marketing budget. You need to **be visible to the right people, consistently.** LaunchPilot makes the "consistently" part manageable.

Your milestone tracker in the dashboard maps this journey for you. Every task is designed to move you one step closer to customer #1.
