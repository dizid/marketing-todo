Hey,

Two weeks in. You've seen what LaunchPilot can do — generate social posts, write emails, build landing pages, analyze competitors. All powered by AI, all in minutes instead of hours.

Now let's talk about what happens when you stop holding back.

**On the free plan, you get 40 AI generations per month.** That's great for getting started. But if you're serious about finding your first 10 customers, here's the reality:

- A week of social content = ~7 generations
- An email outreach sequence = ~3 generations
- A landing page + variations = ~4 generations
- Competitor analysis = ~2 generations

**That's 16 generations for one week of basic marketing.** At 40/month, you'll hit the limit before the month is halfway through.

**LaunchPilot Pro gives you 400 generations per month.**

That's enough to:

- Post on social media **every single day** across multiple platforms
- Write and A/B test **multiple email sequences**
- Build **several landing pages** and test which converts best
- Run **weekly competitor analysis** to stay ahead
- Generate **blog posts, ad copy, and sales scripts** on top of all that

**Plus Pro includes:**

- **Advanced analytics** — see which content performs best
- **Priority support** — get help when you need it
- **Early access** to new features and mini-apps

---

**The price: $19/month.**

Less than a single hour of a freelance copywriter's time. And you get an always-available AI marketing team that works in minutes.

If LaunchPilot has saved you even one hour of writing time in the past 2 weeks, Pro pays for itself many times over.

No long-term commitment. Cancel anytime. But most founders who upgrade don't look back — because the output speaks for itself.

Here's to your next 10 customers,
The LaunchPilot Team
