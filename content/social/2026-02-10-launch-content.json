        "Step 1: Define your ICP in ONE sentence.\n\n\"I help [person] solve [problem] so they can [outcome].\"\n\nIf you can't fill in those blanks clearly, you're not ready to sell yet. Go narrower.",
        "Step 2: Have 20 conversations BEFORE you pitch.\n\nAsk: \"What's the most frustrating part of [problem] for you?\"\n\nYou're not selling. You're learning the exact words your customers use. That's your future copy.",
        "Step 3: Build ONE landing page.\n\n- Headline (their problem)\n- 3 benefits\n- Social proof\n- 1 CTA\n\nA single focused page beats a 10-page site at this stage. Every time.",
        "Step 4: Mine your warm network.\n\nFormer colleagues. LinkedIn connections. Community members. Alumni.\n\nSend 50 personal messages. Expect 5-10 real conversations. That's where your first customers come from.",
        "Step 5: Do things that don't scale.\n\nPersonally onboard every user. Check in at day 3, 7, 14. Fix problems fast.\n\nThese people become your evangelists.\n\nhttps://launchpilot.marketing?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=launch_awareness"

        "LAUNCH DAY:\n\n- Go live before 8am (their timezone)\n- Message your inner circle first\n- Post everywhere you prepared\n- Reply to EVERY comment within 30 min\n- Track metrics hourly -- amplify what works",
        "POST-LAUNCH (30 days):\n\n- Follow up personally with every signup\n- Do 5-10 user interviews\n- Ship top 3 requested features fast\n- Double down on your best channel\n- Set your next milestone: 10 → 50 → 100",

      "content": "I spent 6 months building a product nobody asked for.\n\nThen I spent 3 months building landing pages, writing cold emails, and posting on social media -- with zero customers to show for it.\n\nHere's what I learned the hard way about getting your first 10 customers:\n\nThe problem wasn't my product. It was my process.\n\nI was building in isolation. No customer conversations. No validation. No ICP definition. Just vibes and assumptions.\n\nWhen I finally sat down and talked to 20 people in my target market, everything changed:\n\n- I learned the exact words they used to describe their problem (instant copy improvement)\n- I discovered 3 features I thought were important that nobody cared about\n- I found 5 people who were willing to pay before I even finished building\n\nThe lesson: your first 10 customers come from conversations, not campaigns.\n\nTalk to people. Listen to their words. Build what they need. Then reach out personally -- not with a mass email blast, but with a genuine message that shows you understand their problem.\n\nIt doesn't scale. That's the point.\n\nDo things that don't scale until you've earned the right to automate.\n\nIf you're a solo founder working on getting your first customers, I wrote a complete step-by-step guide: https://launchpilot.marketing/blog/how-to-get-first-10-customers?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=launch_awareness\n\n#founders #startups #customerdiscovery #solofounder"

      "content": "Hot take: most solo founders are using too many AI marketing tools.\n\nI see this pattern constantly:\n\n- ChatGPT for blog drafts\n- Jasper for ad copy\n- Buffer for social scheduling\n- Mailchimp for emails\n- Carrd for landing pages\n- Apollo for outreach\n- GA4 for analytics\n\nThat's 7 tools. 7 logins. 7 billing cycles. And you have to re-explain your brand, audience, and product in each one.\n\nFor a solo founder, context switching is the real productivity killer.\n\nEvery time you jump between tools, you lose focus. You re-enter the same information. You waste time on integration rather than execution.\n\nThe AI marketing tools that actually work for solo founders share three traits:\n\n1. They retain context about your business across sessions\n2. They let you go from idea to published output in minutes, not hours\n3. They consolidate multiple functions so your data and brand voice stay consistent\n\nYou don't need the best email tool AND the best landing page builder AND the best content generator. You need one tool that does all three well enough to ship.\n\nPerfect is the enemy of launched.\n\nI wrote a full breakdown of the AI marketing tool landscape for solo founders -- what's real, what's hype, and how to build your stack at every budget level: https://launchpilot.marketing/blog/ai-marketing-tools-solo-founders?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=launch_awareness\n\n#AImarketing #solofounder #startuptools #marketing"

They wing the preparation and ghost the follow-through.\n\nPreparation and persistence beat hype every time.\n\nI put together a complete launch checklist with every step broken down: https://launchpilot.marketing/blog/launch-checklist-founders?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=launch_awareness\n\n#productlaunch #founders #startups #goToMarket"
