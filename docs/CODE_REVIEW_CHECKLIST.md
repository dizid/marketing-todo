# Code Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing pull requests or committing new code to ensure quality and consistency.

## Architecture & Design

### Configuration-Driven Pattern
- [ ] New tasks use config format (not individual components)?
- [ ] Config follows `taskConfigSchema` structure?
- [ ] Single source of truth for task definition (one config file)?
- [ ] No duplicate task definitions across files?

### Separation of Concerns
- [ ] Components only handle presentation?
- [ ] Business logic in services?
- [ ] State management via Pinia stores?
- [ ] Utilities for reusable functions?

### Mini-App Framework
- [ ] Uses `MiniAppShell` for orchestration (if task has AI)?
- [ ] Composed from FormBuilder, AIPanel, OutputSection?
- [ ] Wrapper component correctly connected to store?
- [ ] Mini-app registered in `miniAppRegistry.js`?

---

## Code Quality

### No Duplication
- [ ] Form fields not repeated across tasks?
- [ ] Validation logic centralized in `formValidation.js`?
- [ ] AI prompts don't repeat similar patterns?
- [ ] Response parsing code not duplicated?

### Naming Conventions
- [ ] Variables: camelCase and descriptive?
- [ ] Functions: clear verb + noun (e.g., `validateEmail`, `generatePosts`)?
- [ ] Components: PascalCase (e.g., `MiniAppShell`)?
- [ ] Files: kebab-case (e.g., `mini-app-shell.vue`)?
- [ ] Config IDs: snake_case, task-prefixed (e.g., `social-1`)?
- [ ] Field IDs: snake_case, meaningful (e.g., `audience_overview`)?

### Code Style
- [ ] Consistent indentation (2 spaces)?
- [ ] No trailing whitespace?
- [ ] Single vs double quotes consistent?
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"?
- [ ] No commented-out code left behind?

---

## Form Configuration

### Field Definitions
- [ ] All required fields have `required: true`?
- [ ] Field `type` is valid (text, email, number, textarea, select, checkboxes, radio)?
- [ ] Field `id` is unique within form?
- [ ] Field `label` is user-friendly?
- [ ] Complex fields have `description` help text?
- [ ] Select/checkboxes/radio have options array?
- [ ] Number fields have `min`/`max` if applicable?
- [ ] Textarea has reasonable `rows` setting?

### Validation
- [ ] Required fields validated on form submit?
- [ ] Email fields use email validator?
- [ ] Number fields have min/max constraints?
- [ ] Custom validators have clear error messages?
- [ ] Validation errors displayed to user (not just console)?
- [ ] Form can't be submitted with validation errors?

### Accessibility
- [ ] All fields have associated labels?
- [ ] Required fields marked with `*`?
- [ ] Error messages associated with fields?

## AI Generation Configuration

### Prompt Template
- [ ] Template uses valid placeholder syntax: `{field_id}`?
- [ ] All placeholders correspond to form field IDs or context?
- [ ] Instructions clear and unambiguous?
- [ ] Format examples included (if structured output expected)?
- [ ] Platform-specific constraints documented (if applicable)?
- [ ] Temperature (0.8) appropriate for task type?
- [ ] Max tokens reasonable for expected output length?

### Response Parsing
- [ ] Parser handles empty/null responses?
- [ ] Parser validates response structure?
- [ ] Error messages user-friendly if parsing fails?
- [ ] Parsed output matches expected format?
- [ ] No assumption about AI response format without validation?

### Context Provider
- [ ] Context function has try-catch for errors?
- [ ] Gracefully continues if context unavailable?
- [ ] All provided values are relevant to prompt?
- [ ] No sensitive data leaking in context?

### Error Handling
- [ ] API errors caught and handled?
- [ ] User-friendly error messages (not stack traces)?
- [ ] "Retry" option available for failed generations?
- [ ] Timeout handling for slow/stuck requests?
- [ ] Logged for debugging (with console.log)?

### Component Props & Events
- [ ] Props have type definitions?
- [ ] Props have default values where appropriate?
- [ ] Events emitted with clear names and payloads?

---

## User Experience

### Feedback & Loading States
- [ ] Loading indicators while API calls in progress?

## Performance
