  - Domain: runway.com TAKEN (business forecasting), runwayml.com TAKEN (AI video)
  - Vibe: Sophisticated, founder-language, premium

- **Upside** - Growth potential + optimistic
  - Domain: upside.com TAKEN ($1.5B cash-back unicorn)
  - Vibe: Professional, positive, finance-savvy

- **Margin** - Profit margins + edge/advantage
  - Domain: margin.app possibly available/for sale 🎯

### Domain Availability Challenges
- Most single-word money/revenue terms are taken by established companies

  1. Use prefixes (get/use/try + name)
  2. Choose unique compounds/portmanteaus
  3. Accept premium domain pricing
  4. Use .app/.ai instead of .com/.io

## Open Questions

1. **Name Decision:** Which name best balances availability + brand values?
   - Monetix? (unique, available)
   - Gainforge? (strong, builder-focused)
   - Margin? (sophisticated, .app might be available)
   - Prefix option? (getrunway.com, trypayday.io)

2. **Freemium Balance:** Is 10 AI queries/month right for free tier?
   - Too generous? (gives away too much)
   - Too stingy? (prevents proper evaluation)

3. **Target Market Priority:** Start with?
   - App creators (iOS/Android developers)
   - SaaS builders (web app founders)
   - Digital shop owners (e-commerce)
   - All of the above (broader but less focused)

4. **AI Positioning:** How prominent should AI be in marketing?
   - Lead with AI? ("AI-powered marketing assistant")
   - Background feature? ("Smart marketing checklist")
   - Hybrid? ("Marketing checklist with AI guidance")

## Key Insights from Analysis

### What We Learned
- **Market Gap Confirmed:** No competitor offers AI + marketing-specific + indie pricing
- **Domain Scarcity:** Most direct money/revenue terms taken by established companies
- **Price Sensitivity:** Indie makers need <$20/month to consider paid tools
- **Simplicity Matters:** Complexity is barrier (Airtable/ClickUp overwhelming)
- **Outcome > Features:** Target audience cares about making money, not task management

### Strategic Implications
- Position as **outcome-focused** (monetization) not feature-focused (tasks)
- Emphasize **simplicity** vs. complex enterprise PM tools
- Lead with **free tier** to overcome trust barrier
- Use **AI as differentiator** but don't over-complicate messaging
- Focus on **indie maker communities** (Indie Hackers, Twitter, Product Hunt)

## Appendix: Rejected Name Ideas

These were explored but didn't make the cut:

- **LaunchKit** - Too literal, domains heavily taken
- **TractionTrack** - Generic, sounds like analytics
- **RevenueRun** - Awkward alliteration
- **Breakthrough** - Vague, not specific to money
- **Sparkloop** - Confusing, sounds like email tool
- **Sellout** - Too provocative, risky
- **Coinage** - Unclear, dated term
- **Earnest** - Too wholesome, weak association
