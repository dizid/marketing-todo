5 = Critical - Essential for core product value or preventing churn
4 = High - Significantly improves user experience or enables new use cases
3 = Medium - Useful improvement that many users would appreciate
2 = Low - Nice enhancement that benefits a small segment
1 = Minimal - Cosmetic or rarely used

Questions to ask:
‚Ä¢ How many users would benefit?
‚Ä¢ Would it increase customer satisfaction/NPS?
‚Ä¢ Would it reduce customer churn?
‚Ä¢ Is it a blocker for closing sales?
‚Ä¢ Does it differentiate from competitors?`,

1 = Trivial (1-2 hours)
2 = Simple (1-2 days)
3 = Medium (1-2 weeks)
4 = Complex (1-2 months)
5 = Very Complex (3+ months)

Factors to consider:
‚Ä¢ Design work needed?
‚Ä¢ Backend changes required?
‚Ä¢ Frontend changes required?
‚Ä¢ Database migrations?
‚Ä¢ Testing and QA effort?
‚Ä¢ Documentation needed?
‚Ä¢ Training/rollout effort?
‚Ä¢ Dependencies on other systems?`,

    alignmentTemplate: `BUSINESS ALIGNMENT CHECK:

Strategic Fit:

Risk Assessment:
‚òê Technical risks identified
‚òê Dependencies documented
‚òê Mitigation plans in place
‚òê Resource availability confirmed
‚òê Timeline realistic

Go/No-Go Decision:
‚òê Move forward
‚òê More research needed
‚òê Defer to next quarter
‚òê Reject/close`
