      why: 'This tells you which marketing channels are working. Focus your budget on channels that bring the best users.',
      example: 'Track: "Twitter", "Product Hunt", "Google", "Friend referral"'

      description: 'What % of sign-ups become paying customers?',
      why: 'If you get 100 sign-ups but 0 pay, you have a product problem, not a marketing problem. Conversion rate tells you if your product is valuable.',
      example: 'Formula: (Paid Customers / Total Sign-ups) √ó 100. Target: 5-10% is good for most products.'

      description: 'How much revenue comes from each marketing channel?',

      description: 'What % of customers are still using you after 30 days? 90 days?',
      why: 'Retention is more important than sign-ups. If 90% leave after a week, you have a serious problem. Track how many users are still active over time.',

      why: 'If users take 2 months to see value, many will quit. Track how quickly users see benefits. Faster = better retention.',
