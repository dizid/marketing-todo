---

## 🎯 TIER 2: VERY GOOD (75-84)

### 7-11: [Similar detailed breakdowns for Competitor Intelligence, Lead Magnet Ideas, Funnel Blueprint, Objection Handling, Cold Outreach]
**Average Score:** 80/100

These are all strong, actionable tasks with comprehensive frameworks. Common strengths include multi-section approaches and real-world guidance. Main weaknesses: some lack specific AI customization, missing benchmark data, could have more detailed examples.

---

## 🎯 TIER 3: GOOD (65-74)

### 12-15: [Executive Summary, Analytics Setup, Channel Analyzer, ROI Calculator]
**Average Score:** 70/100

Functional tools that solve problems but either: (1) generic/one-time utility, (2) limited scope, or (3) lack AI/integration. Examples: Analytics Setup changes rapidly, Channel Analyzer only compares 4 channels, ROI Calculator is basic math without optimization suggestions.

---

## 🎯 TIER 4: MODERATE (55-64)

### 16-21: [Publish Updates, Design Graphics, Engage Followers, Iterate Features, Collect Feedback, Create Video Tutorial]
**Average Score:** 58/100

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** These tasks are MISLEADINGLY NAMED:
- "Design Graphics" = just brief generator (no actual design)
- "Create Video Tutorial" = just script outline (no video creation)
- "Engage Followers" = pre-written response templates (no AI personalization)

These tasks:
- Have no AI or minimal AI
- Are essentially glorified templates/checklists
- Would score 15+ points higher with AI generation or actual integrations
- Premium tier placement unjustified for many

---

## 🎯 TIER 5: BASIC (45-54)

### 22-29: [Run Giveaway, Post in Communities, Video Tutorial, Host Webinar, Connect Accounts, Prepare Assets, Tracking Sheet, Landing Page]
**Average Score:** 48/100

**Major Issues:**
- One-time setup utility (low recurring value)
- Template lists without customization
- Just guides/checklists
- No integrations
- No AI
- Premium tier too high for utility delivered

**Examples:**
- "Connect Accounts" = just list + guides (doesn't actually connect anything)
- "Prepare Assets" = checklist + tool list (no asset creation)
- "Landing Page Creator" = 5-step wizard to PLAN page (doesn't create pages)

---

## 🎯 TIER 6: MINIMAL (<45)

### 30-33: [Launch Paid Ads, Optimize Ads, Channel Optimizer (hidden), Personalized Outreach]
**Average Score:** 42/100

Just platform guides/educational content. No strategy, no data import, no optimization engine, no actual execution support.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Problem 1: MISLEADING TASK NAMES
These tasks promise more than they deliver:

| Task Name | Reality | Should Be Named |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| "Create Video Tutorial" | Script outline only | "Video Script Outline Generator" |
| "Design Graphics" | Brief generator only | "Design Brief Generator" |
| "Connect Accounts" | List + guides only | "Account Connection Guide" |
| "Prepare Assets" | Checklist only | "Asset Organization Checklist" |
| "Landing Page Creator" | 5-step planning wizard | "Landing Page Planning Wizard" |

### Problem 2: NON-AI TASKS UNDERPERFORM
11 pure template/UI tasks average **54.1/100** vs AI tasks **76.2/100**
- 29% lower quality (improved from 34%)
- Mostly guides/checklists without AI
- Premium tier justification weak for many
- Would need AI generation or actual integrations to justify premium pricing
- **NOTE:** "Write Blog Post" is NO LONGER in this category - upgraded to 90/100 with full AI generation

### Problem 3: PREMIUM TIER MISALIGNMENT
These should be FREE or BUNDLED (not premium):
- Connect Accounts (one-time setup utility)
- Prepare Assets (just checklist)
- Set Up Tracking Sheet (just template download)
- Design Graphics (just brief generator)
- Engage Followers (pre-written responses)
- Run Giveaway (just 5-step wizard)
- Post in Communities (just directory)
- Create Video Tutorial (just script outline)
- Host Webinar (just planning template)

**NOTE:** "Blog Post Generator" removed from this list - now full-featured premium task (90/100 score)

### Problem 4: HELP TEXT INCONSISTENCY
- Excellent tasks: 9-10/10 help score
- Poor tasks: 4-6/10 help score
- Many missing common mistakes section
- Many have only 1 example (should be 2)
- Guidance quality varies dramatically

### Problem 5: NO INTEGRATIONS
Zero API integrations with:
- Canva/Figma (for design)
- Mailchimp/ConvertKit (for email)
- Typeform/Qualtrics (for surveys)
- Unbounce/Leadpages (for landing pages)
- HubSpot/Salesforce (for CRM)
- Google Ads/Facebook Ads (for ad management)

Tasks would be 3-5x more valuable with integrations.

## 💡 KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

### IMMEDIATE (1-2 days)
1. **Fix misleading names** - Update 6+ task names to match reality
2. **Move free tier tasks** - 8 setup tasks to Free tier (saves users $)
3. **Add "common mistakes" section** to 15+ tasks lacking it
4. **Add 2nd example** to 20+ tasks with only 1 example

### SHORT-TERM (1-2 weeks)
1. **Add AI to top 10 non-AI tasks** - Would increase avg score 40%
2. **Link to external tools** - Sample size calculators, template downloads, etc.
3. **Standardize help text** - All tasks should have min 8/10 score
4. **Add quick-start templates** - 50+ copy/paste ready templates per task

### MEDIUM-TERM (1 month)
1. **API integrations** - Start with Canva, Mailchimp, Typeform
2. **Data import** - CSV for analytics/channel data
3. **Export options** - PDF, Word, email send (not just markdown)
4. **Task sequencing** - Suggest next logical task after completion
5. **Results dashboard** - Track outputs and outcomes over time

### LONG-TERM (Strategic)
1. **Retire bottom 10 tasks** - They feel incomplete and low-value
2. **Focus on top 15 tasks** - Make them absolutely exceptional
3. **Build 5 new integrated tasks** - Deep partnerships with external tools
4. **Community outputs** - Showcase successful task outputs from users

Tasks 1-10. These are production-ready and stand up to industry comparison.

- 2-3 weeks work each
- Would move to TIER A after improvements

### TIER C: RETIRE OR REBUILD (Bottom 12)
Tasks 21-32. Feel incomplete/low-value.
- Score: 45-64/100
- Either retire them or completely rebuild with AI/integrations

**Strengths:**
- Top 6 AI tasks are 90-96/100 (world-class)
- Comprehensive funnel coverage
- Free tier is generous (15 free, 17 premium)
- Top 15 tasks are production-ready
- Real-world, actionable output
- **NEW:** Blog Post Generator brought to 90/100 parity standard

**Weaknesses:**

- Premium tier pricing mismatch for ~38% of premium tasks (down from 40%)
- Help text quality inconsistent (4-10/10 range)
- Zero API integrations
- Non-AI tasks average 29% lower score (improved from 34%)

**Improvements Made (This Session):**

- ✅ Reduced non-AI tasks: 12 → 11
- ✅ Overall average: 67.2/100 → 68.5/100

**Verdict:**
Quality over quantity. Top 15 tasks are competitive with paid tools. Bottom 12 tasks need complete rebuild or retirement. Blog Post Generator now joins the elite tier of world-class tasks.

**Strategic Path:**
Improve next highest-value task in TIER 2 (estimated +15-25 points). Target: "Design Graphics" or "Lead Magnet Ideas" for similar treatment. Retire/rebuild bottom 12. Result: 20-25 exceptional tasks instead of 32 mixed-quality tasks.
